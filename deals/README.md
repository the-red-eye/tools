# Deal Finding Tools

Tools for finding and analyzing deals for resale arbitrage.

## Strategy

1. Monitor deal channels (Telegram, newsletters)
2. Filter by criteria (discount %, margin, effort)
3. Analyze resale potential
4. Track profitable categories

## Criteria

Good deals typically have:
- Investment ≤ €60
- Discount > 50%
- Estimated margin > €15
- Low effort (small, easy to ship)

## Categories that work well

- Perfumes (high margin, easy to verify authenticity)
- Sneakers (strong resale market)
- LEGO (especially retired sets)
- Powerbanks/electronics accessories
- Brand clothing (off-season)

## Categories to avoid

- Expensive electronics (saturated market)
- AirPods (too many fakes)
- Heavy/bulky items (shipping kills margin)
